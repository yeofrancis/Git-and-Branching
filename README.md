#### The 10 Basic Commands of Git that I use
  1. git add .\
     tell git to add or include all files in the next commit
  2. git commit -m "descriptions"\
     takes all added files and commits them to project history
  3. git push\
     move all committed changes to remote repository.
  4. git status\
     display current status of working directory
  5. git clone <repo_name>\
     make a duplicate of an existing Git repository
  6. git checkout -b <new_branch_name>\
     create a new branch on your local machine and open it
  7. git branch -d <branch_name>
     delete a branch on your local machine
  8. git pull\
     get all changes from the remote to your local copy
  9. git merge <branch_name>\
     integrate all changes from another branch into yours
  10. git stash\
      stores uncommitted changes for use latter and subsequently reverts them from your working copy
