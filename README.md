# Branching Strategy

User Story : A 3-months new start-up with 2 small group of developers handling separately Frontend and Backend development.
The company have been using Git, and want to have a more organise and structure process in Source Code Management.
The DevOps is tasked to set up an appropriate SCM framework taking into the below considerations:

 - features, bugfixes tested successfully are to deploy to production on every last Friday of the month
 - patches and bugfixes done can be replace before release to production
 - features test successfully can be drop before release to production
